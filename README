- TIFFLib installed
- A python interpreter
- For data analysis, the R interpreter


INSTALLING

The installer will download required data from the WorldPop database.
Data for one country could range within 5-10Gb.
Downloading might take a long time.

- Edit the install.sh file and modify the following parameters:
  CORES: the number of cores used by each simulation.
  GRIDRES: the resolution in km.
  COUNTRY: the name of the country of interest.
  OUTDIR: name of the directory where to store results:
          this will be a sub directory of the Output directory.

- Run the installer with
  bash install.sh





FORECASTING

To build forecasting runs, just type

make

This will take several minutes to complete, so relax and take a cup of tea or coffee. 
It will build two versions: the first is a version that only generates the mobility
data needed to move individuals around.  The second will perform the actual calculations.

If you prefer to build the two version separately, type:

make write
make read

To run a set of 100 sims just type
python3 multirun.py

The python script may be modified to increase the number of runs at will.

If on a cluster, you can adapt the submission 'script.sh' to your needs.
